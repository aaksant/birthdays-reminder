# Birthday Reminder

This is the first React app I've created. I'm happy with this project because I didn't use any helps from AI tools (smiles happily). 

In this project, I learned about:
- Using `props` to render component.
- Passing `props` from parent component to child components.
- What is state and how to use the `useState` hook.

My thoughts about React so far:
- Callback functions will be used frequently. So far I used callback functions in button-like components.
